      <p><b>Sunder Nursery</b> also known as Azim Bagh, in Delhi primarily features historical landscapes and diverse plant life. While it may not be directly associated with complex mathematical concepts, the design and layout could involve basic geometric principles for pathways, symmetry in garden arrangements, and potentially some landscaping calculations. </p>

    <h1>Some potential concepts include:</h1>

        <h2 class="w3-xxxlarge"><b>Geometry</b></h1>
        <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid blue" class="w3-round">
        <p>The layout of pathways, flower beds, and other features may involve geometric shapes and proportions. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pathway Design:</b> The layout of pathways often follows geometric patterns, such as grids, circles, or interlocking shapes, contributing to an organized and aesthetically pleasing design.</li>
          <li><b>Flower Bed Shape:</b> The arrangement of flower beds may involve geometric shapes like circles, squares, or rectangles, creating a sense of order and symmetry in the garden.</li>
          <li><b>Fountain or Water Feature Design:</b> If there are fountains or water features, their design might incorporate geometric shapes in the form of pools, basins, or spouts.</li>
          <li><b>Structural Elements:</b> Any architectural structures within the garden, such as pavilions or archways, may have geometrically inspiblue designs.</li>
          <li><b>Plant Arrangement:</b> The layout of trees, shrubs, and other plants could follow geometric patterns to achieve a balanced and harmonious visual effect.</li>

        <h2 class="w3-xxxlarge"><b>Symmetry</b></h1>
        <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid blue" class="w3-round">
        <p>Gardens often use symmetry to create aesthetically pleasing designs. This could involve mirror symmetry or radial symmetry in the layout of plants and features.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mirror symmetry:</b> The layout of pathways, plant beds, or architectural features may exhibit mirror symmetry, where one side of the garden is a reflection of the other. This creates a balanced and visually appealing arrangement. </li><br>
            <li><b>Radial Symmetry:</b> Certain focal points, such as a central fountain or a circular garden bed, may demonstrate radial symmetry. This involves elements radiating outward from a central point, providing a harmonious and balanced design.</li><br>
            <li><b>Bilateral Symmetry in Planting:</b> The placement of plants on either side of a central axis might follow bilateral symmetry, enhancing the visual balance of the landscape.</li><br>
            <li><b>Architectural Symmetry:</b> Symmetry may be incorporated into the design of pavilions, archways, or other structures within the garden, contributing to a cohesive and pleasing aesthetic.</li>

      <h2 class="w3-xxxlarge"><b>Proportion and Scaling</b></h2>
      <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid blue" class="w3-round">
      <p>Ensuring that different elements in the garden are in proportion to each other and scaled appropriately for the overall design.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Plant Size and Placement:</b> Proportion is likely consideblue in the selection and placement of plants to ensure a harmonious balance. Different plant sizes and shapes may be strategically arranged to create visual interest and avoid a sense of imbalance.</li>
        <li><b>Pathway Width and Length:</b> The width and length of pathways are likely scaled to accommodate pedestrian traffic comfortably while maintaining a sense of proportion with the surrounding greenery and architectural features.</li>
        <li><b>Structural Elements:</b> Proportion is likely taken into account in the design of any architectural structures within the garden, such as pavilions, archways, or seating areas. These elements should be appropriately scaled to fit within the overall landscape.</li>
        <li><b>Water Features:</b> If there are ponds, fountains, or other water features, their size and scale are likely chosen to complement the surrounding environment and maintain proportional relationships with nearby elements.</li>
        <li><b>Open Spaces:</b> Proportionate allocation of open spaces within the garden ensures a balanced feel. This could involve considering the ratio of planted areas to open lawns or gathering spaces.</li>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h2 class="w3-xxxlarge"><b>Spatial Arrangements</b></h1>
  <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid blue" class="w3-round">
  <p>Consideration of spatial relationships between different elements, such as the distance between trees or the arrangement of seating areas.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Plant Layout:</b> The arrangement of trees, shrubs, and other plants is likely carefully consideblue to create a visually appealing composition. Groupings and spacing contribute to a harmonious distribution of greenery.</li>
    <li><b>Open Areas:</b> The allocation and distribution of open spaces, such as lawns or gathering areas, are likely designed to provide balance and allow for various activities within the garden.</li>
    <li><b>Pathway Design:</b> The spatial arrangement of pathways is essential for guiding visitors through the garden. Pathways may be strategically placed to offer different perspectives and highlight key features.</li>
    <li><b>Seating and Rest Areas:</b> The placement of benches, seating areas, or rest spots would be arranged to encourage relaxation and appreciation of the surroundings. These areas may be strategically located to take advantage of scenic views.</li>
    <li><b>Focal Points:</b> Spatial arrangement is likely used to highlight focal points within the garden, such as sculptures, water features, or architectural elements, creating points of interest for visitors.</li>
